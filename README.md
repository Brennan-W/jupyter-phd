# jupyter-phd
Jupyter notebooks used for various projects in grad school. The courses in my field are generally taught in Matlab. I prefer to work in python with open-source packages. As notebooks that I build are completed, I will place them here.

## Reference, Extend - Don't Plagerize
The content here is presented in the spirit of open-source software and making problem solving more accessible. The code in this notebook is original but was built with referencing many other snippets online. Per the included lincense, feel free to use and extend this software. 

Do not represent these notebooks, in whole or in part, as your own original work. By being public on GitHub, these files are subject to detection in plagerism scanners. 

## Using Jupyter for Academic Work
I use Jupyter Notebooks to combine markdown and code, then export the entire thing as markdown. More information on exporting notebooks using nbconvert can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) My favorite markdown editor is <link> Typora [Typora](https://github.com/typora "Typora on GitHub"). There is often some re-arranging needed when working with the notebook as markdown. Once done, Typora can export the file as PDF. That PDF is what get's submitted for the assignment.
